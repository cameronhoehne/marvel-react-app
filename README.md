## marvel-react-app

This is a search engine app I made in react to better understand APIs and fetching data from them, as well as increase my skill in react.

I developed this project because I wanted to get better at working with APIs, and chose Marvel API as it has a lot of information and is very accessible to developers.

This project utilizes the Marvel API, react, and framer motion for animations. Some of the main challenges I overcame in developing this app came from figuring out how each of the different elements from different places fit together. The process was: implement my idea, realize something new is broken, research why it's broken, solve the problem, rinse and repeat. As frustrating as the bugs were (and are), I enjoyed the process and came away with a much deeper understanding of APIs and react.
